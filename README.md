# Using printed images to create a coordinate system for the classroom

Detect known 2D images in the user's environment, and use their positions as reference points for a coordinate system, and also as reference points for generating the extrinsic calibration of cameras placed at fixed locations in the classroom.

## Overview

The coordinate system can be defined with 3 reference locations, which can be configured by placing 3 known images in the classroom at specific locations.  The first two are placed along a wall, and provide a reference line along that wall. The next image would be placed on an adjacent wall perpendicular to the first. The last two images can be used to define the extents (width and length) of the classroom.

## Getting Started

The images should be positioned as described above before starting the app.  Once everything is in place, start the app, and start scanning the floor.  You should see the floor plane being recognized and extended.  Once the the floor area is large enough, you can start scanning the reference images.  Images should be shown to the app in a counter clockwise fashion.
